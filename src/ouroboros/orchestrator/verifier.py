"""External verifier loop (RFC v2 H1, #830).

Wraps a leaf executor with a separate read-only verifier pass plus a
bounded retry. The verifier is intentionally model-agnostic at this
layer: it is any callable that, given the active profile, the leaf's
parsed evidence record, the AC text, and the raw leaf output, returns a
VerifierVerdict.

This module is wiring-only at the orchestrator seam — `parallel_executor`
is not yet routed through `run_with_verifier`. The integration PR follows
once the failure taxonomy (H7) and routing (H5) hooks are in place. For
now this gives downstream PRs a stable, fully-tested loop they can plug
the real LLM-backed verifier into.

Loop semantics:
    1. Executor produces a leaf output.
    2. The harness parses evidence (H2). If evidence cannot be extracted,
       that counts as a FAIL with a parser reason — verifier is NOT called.
    3. The harness validates the record against profile.evidence_schema.
       If the record fails validation, the verifier is short-circuited
       and the loop retries (the leaf would never satisfy the contract
       even if the verifier said PASS).
    4. Otherwise the verifier is invoked. PASS → return. FAIL → retry,
       feeding the verdict reasons back to the executor.
    5. After `max_retries` exhausted FAILs, return the last attempt with
       accepted=False so the outer orchestrator can escalate.

The retry budget defaults to K=2 per shaun0927's H1 sketch in #830.
