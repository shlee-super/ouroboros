"""Per-dispatch context budget governance (RFC v2 H6, #830).

H6 keeps the harness in control of what flows into each leaf dispatch.
Without governance, the layered PRE/POST wrappers (H3) plus profile
metadata plus sibling status plus parent summary plus the AC text plus
the body can balloon a single dispatch well past a healthy budget.

This module gives the dispatch path a single, deterministic place to
compose those segments, summarise sibling status to status lines
(never bodies), and trim parent context when the budget is tight.

The budget is measured in characters here rather than tokens. Char
budgets are deterministic, profile-author-readable, and good enough
for the structural guardrail H6 is about — tightening to tokenizer
counts can come later when there's evidence the char approximation
misses something load-bearing.

This PR is wiring-only. parallel_executor still composes context
ad-hoc until PR 9 routes context assembly through compose_context.
